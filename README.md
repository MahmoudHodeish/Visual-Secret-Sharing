# Visual-Secret-Sharing
scheme is a new direction of the cryptography proposed by Moni Naor and Adi Shamir [5] in 1994 as a subset of secret sharing  used to encode visual information (images, texts, written materials, etc.) in such a way that the decoding process can be done by Human Visual System (HVS) without any complex computation.
